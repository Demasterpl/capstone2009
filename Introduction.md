# Synopsis #

For this course, we will be creating a Microsoft Windows-based photo editing application. As of now, our current focus is to create a GUI and get that working. Use of the Fast-Light Toolkit (FLTK) was suggested for the GUI, but our team (Team 4) is considering using the Windows Form built-in to Visual Studio 2008 instead.

I uploaded a very coarse proof-of-concept into the subversion trunk of this code project. You can use Subversion to download it (see Source tab).
